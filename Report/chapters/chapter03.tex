In this chapter the different datasets used will be introduced. The goal of this project is to use as many datasets possible and then later evaluate them according to relevant results.

\section{Folkehelseinstituttet}
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) have weekly updates\cite{fhi} on the development on the current influenza season as well as previous ones. The reports include numbers of diagnoses from general practitioners (GPs) considering influenza-like symptoms (ILI), and hospitalized virus observations with graphs of both. No numbers are appended to the ILI but upon further request this was provided. Exact numbers are only included for the three last years, therefore the project only uses the seasons of the years 2015/2016, 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. The reports covers how many Norwegians seek treatment for ILI and what kind of influenza viruses are circulating in the country and where, vaccine status and recommendations, as well as the overall prognosis of this season. GPs report flue-like symptoms based on these characteristics: muscle pain, coughing, fever and the feeling of being sick.

\section{Vegvesenet}
The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA), or Vegvesenet as it is called in Norwegian, have several different collections of data available for a number of different purposes. The motivation of this project requires traffic data of how many cars pass a certain registration station at a given time at a given position, the hypothesis for this that when people are ill they commute less and thus this shows on statistical data. Freely on their website \cite{vegvesenet} there are a few interesting options. They have traffic information in the standard traffic management exchange data structure (DATEX) application programming interface (API), statistics in an extensible markup language (XLM) and traffic index data relevant to the years before. It is important that the data collected is on a weekly basis at least in order to compare it to the influenza data. The data on their website does not suffice for this purpose, traffic data is only registered on a yearly and monthly basis. Luckily upon further investigation and help from the NPRA better data was granted upon request, hidden from that available on their website. The data given contained a set of traffic registration stations throughout Norway. With this statistics of the daily traffic amount and spatial bounds can be derived showing the possible correlation influenza can have on traffic. The regions of interest are the whole of Norway and the three cities of Stavanger, Bergen and Oslo.

\section{Twitter}
The reason twitter data is interesting is that it contains self-reported instances of influenza on an individual level. These self-reported cases may even occur without the patient visiting a doctor, and so capture otherwise non-reported instances of ILI. The advantages are an instant notification about possible influenza-like illness and its spread, against the disadvantages of it being self-reported and thus somewhat unreliable. Twitter has several APIs available for public use, the one used in this project is the REST or search API which allows for searching against a set of keywords. The representational state transfer (REST) API is limited though, data accessible is roughly only maximum 10 days old and the search limit is on a maximum of one hundred messages called 'tweets'. The other API of interest is the stream API which continually gets the latest tweets. In order to only get Norwegian tweets, a set of geographical locations needs to be defined. The reason the stream API was not used is firstly that it requires a computer running on the internet continuously in order to get all the desired tweets. Secondly, the data collected could become large slowing down other post-processing algorithms and taking up unnecessary storage. Lastly, the stream API only provides a small set of the actual tweets tweeted, this means when searching for a specific term using the stream API some relevant tweets could go unnoticed and thus a search API is more appropriate for this task.

\section{Kolumbus}
Kolumbus is the public transportation administration in the state of Rogaland in Norway, this includes Stavanger, a city of interest. Unfortunately, Kolumbus provides no API, but on further request data of monthly passenger travel was provided from the years of 2015-2017.

\section{Ruter}
Ruter is the public transportation administration in the state of Oslo in Norway. Unfortunately Ruter's API does not include passenger or tickets sold information, this was provided on request for the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and up till 27 of February for the year 2018.
