This thesis was written for the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Stavanger. Creating a means to solve  problems that limit peoples lives have always been a real motivator. Predicting the flu season and hindering it in early stages would save an enormous amount of resources and improve life quality, this would be very rewarding. A special thanks to the supervisor for this project from the University of Stavanger Professor Erlend TÃ¸ssebro for his enthusiastic guidance and involvement, and the initiator who inspired incentive to the creation of this project as well as his continuous helpful guidance and involvement Phd fellow Lars Ole Grottenberg.
