Influenza epidemics cost both lives and a tremendous amount of resources for any country. Citizens that become sick are less productive and the overall quality of life is drastically reduced for the amount of the individuals period of illness as well as the community during a flu season. The ability to reduce the spread of infectious diseases saves both lives and resources as well as an improvement of the quality of life. \\

This project aims to explore the possibilities to detect influenza outbreaks as soon as they are happening with the use of relevant datasets available. Information about different aspects of a citizens life on a grand scale reveals patterns and trends that could be linked to an epidemic outbreak, and thus prove useful for active measurements against the further spread on an early d√©but. \\

The results show that creating an automated responsive real-time warning system to detect influenza is achievable, and the program presented by this thesis is a prototype of what such a warning system may look like. It contains a basic assembly of core features and is also modular and scalable making future work possible. Further development of such a program, be that for influenza purposes or other, would be highly ethical as it would be an exceptional aid to ameliorate the purposed predicament.
